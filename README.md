## Technologies Used
- Python
- Matplotlib
- Adobe Illustrator (for graphical assets)

# 1. Extract the TappingFootForcePair ZIP file into a folder.
# 2. Ensure that the folder contains:
#    - The Python code file (.py)
#    - An "assets" folder with the following subfolders:
#        - "foot" folder with foot images
